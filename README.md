## Your Task
1. Fork and clone this repository
1. Browse online to find a calculator you find aesthetically pleasing or interesting (it can be in google images, in your house, on your phone). 
1. Draw/make a wireframe and add it as a file or picture inside this repository
1. Using HTML and Sass, build a calculator. Don't worry about functionality, and it actually calculating operations. Just focus on the SCSS!
    - Create a mixin that can change the theme of the calculator from dark mode to light mode, depending on what argument is passed to the mixin
    - Using arithmetic operators, make your calculator resize in relation to the screen size
        - Example:  `width: 2rem + 1vw;`
    - Create a hover effect for each number button on the calculator that does the following inside a for loop:
        1. Decreases the size of all other number buttons on the calculator
        2. Darkens all other number buttons 
        3. Bolds the text of your operation buttons (i.e. "+", "=", etc.)


## Set Up
1. Create an `index.html` file and a `main.scss`.
1. Use your Sass compiler to compile your Sass files to CSS.
1. Link the CSS file to `index.html`


## Extra Practice
- Spend as much time as you want making the calculator look fancy!
- Add basic fnctionality to the calculator using JavaScript
- Deep dive into the Sass docs: 
    - Look into additional [at-rules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules) not covered in class
    - Learn about [built-in modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules)
